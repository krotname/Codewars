     * The new "Avengers" movie has just been released! There are a lot of people at the cinema box office standing in a huge line. Each of them has a single 100, 50 or 25 dollar bill. An "Avengers" ticket costs 25 dollars.
     * <p>
     * Vasya is currently working as a clerk. He wants to sell a ticket to every single person in this line.
     * <p>
     * Can Vasya sell a ticket to every person and give change if he initially has no money and sells the tickets strictly in the order people queue?
     * <p>
     * Return YES, if Vasya can sell a ticket to every person and give change with the bills he has at hand at that moment. Otherwise return NO.
